          I'm a Lahore-based UI/UX Designer with over 4 years of professional experience in creating intuitive, visually compelling digital products. I specialize in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and visual design. My passion lies in designing meaningful user experiences that solve real-world problems.

          I believe great design starts with understanding people â€” their needs, behaviors, and preferences. That's why I combine user research and usability testing with creative thinking to design user-first solutions.
